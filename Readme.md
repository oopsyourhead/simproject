# 	This file is a very simple 1-Dimensional python simulation of a radar system scanning across a swath of azimuth and detecting and displaying targets
##  	it will output a text file (output.txt) that will contain the outputs, as well as a console output
##		multiple scans has been implemented as of 3/25/2020

#### 	maybe next implement speed/mtr filter (changed filter to account for target headings, implemented 3/27/2020)
####	implement a logging function to record when target characteristics change (finished 3/30/2020)

####	in the future implement 2 dimensions for targets, beam structure, target range, target elevation, target xyz, add in elevation angles, bars, different modes
