# 	This file is a very simple 1-Dimensional python simulation of a radar system scanning across a swath of azimuth and detecting and displaying targets
##  	it will output a text file (output.txt) that will contain the outputs, as well as a console output

## Blue  	maybe next implement speed/mtr filter, scan multiple times in a row

##	in the future implement beam structure, target range, target elevation, target xyz, add in elevation angles, bars, different modes
